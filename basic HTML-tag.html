        <h1>Basic Tags</h1>
        <p> Tags are small snippets of HTML coding that tell engines how to properly “read”
             your content. ...<br> This information helps engines like Google determine what your
              content is about and how to categorize the material.<br> Some of them also improve 
              how visitors view your content in those search engines.
              <p>
              The most important tags for an HTML document is doctype, <!--<HTML>, <head> and <body>-->. 
                Doctype is the doctype declaration type. 
                  It is used for specifying which version of HTML the document is using
                </p>
                
        </p>
    </body>
</html>
